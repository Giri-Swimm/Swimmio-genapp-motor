title: Deleting Policy Records (LGDPVS01) - Overview
---
# Overview

This document explains the flow of deleting a policy record and logging any errors encountered during the process. When a request is received with a customer and policy number, the system attempts to remove the corresponding policy record. If the deletion fails, detailed error information is captured and logged for audit and troubleshooting.
